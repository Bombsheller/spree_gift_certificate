SpreeGiftCertificate
====================

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add spree_gift_certificate to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_gift_certificate'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_gift_certificate:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
