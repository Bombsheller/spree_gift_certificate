SpreeGiftCertificate
====================

This gem allows purchasing of gift certificates for Spree ecommerce stores.
The gift certificates are redeemed as store credit, so there is a dependency on
the `spree_store_credit` gem.
The payment method for gift certificates differs from other gift card gems (like
spree_gift_card or spree_vouchers) in that it has its own checkout flow because
it seemed incredibly unnecessary to me to try to shoehorn a gift certificate into
a `Spree::Product` when it's not really a product, but a transfer of value, and
thus isn't subject to things like shipping, addresses, etc.
That is, it being *entirely* virtual, it didn't make sense to deal with all of the
overhead that comes with dealing with physical products.
As such, it only integrates with Stripe checkout right now.

Installation
------------

Add spree_gift_certificate to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_gift_certificate'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_gift_certificate:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_gift_certificate/factories'
```
